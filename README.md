The challenge is on Frontend Mentor and I was supposed to make a 3 card responsive column. 

I didn't use any css framework to honestly improve my skills with css. 

I wasn't sure was to approach this with flexbox or grids but i decided on flexbox at the end.


I deviated a little bit in the font-size to be able to view the text much more clearly.
